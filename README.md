# Comprehensive Coffee Sales Performance Analysis (NYC 2023)
## Project Overview
Comprehensive data analysis focused on translating sales performance metrics into actionable business strategies. Key outcomes include optimizing staff distribution, mitigating revenue loss from data gaps, and implementing targeted sales tactics based on unique customer purchase behavior.
## Key Insights
* **Seasonal Skew:** Q2 was the highest-performing quarter, while the overall average was heavily affected by 8 weeks of missing data (Q3-Q4).
* **Store Performance:** Identified Store 8 as the best performer and Store 5 as a high-potential branch due to its high quantity-per-invoice behavior.
*  **Staffing Strategy:** Analysis of hourly revenue peaks (morning rush) suggests a critical need to rebalance staffing between morning and evening shifts.
